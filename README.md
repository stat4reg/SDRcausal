# SDRcausal
The package implements the methods described in Ghosh et al. (2020): Sufficient Dimension Reduction for Feasible and Robust Estimation of Average Causal Effect. It uses a semiparametric locally efficient dimension reduction approach to assess both the treatment assignment mechanism and the average responses in both treated and nontreated groups. It then integrates all results through imputation, inverse probability weighting and doubly robust augmentation estimators.
